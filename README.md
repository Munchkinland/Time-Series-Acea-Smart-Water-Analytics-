🔍 This README provides a comprehensive guide for the Time-Series-Acea-Smart-Water-Analytics project. The project is focused on analyzing time-series data related to smart water management, with a specific focus on the Aquifer Auser dataset.

🌐 Project Overview
The Time-Series-Acea-Smart-Water-Analytics project aims to analyze and predict water resource behaviors using time-series data. The primary dataset used in this project is Aquifer_Auser.csv, which contains various measurements related to an aquifer in Italy.

🔧 Installation
Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

📦 NumPy
📦 Pandas
📦 Matplotlib
📦 Seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
💡 Usage
The project structure is as follows:

📁 utils.py: Contains utility functions such as db_connect for database connections.

📊 Data analysis scripts that perform the following tasks:

Data Ingestion
Descriptive Data Analysis
Data Visualization
Data Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Time Series Analysis
Database Connection
To connect to the database, use:

from utils import db_connect
engine = db_connect()
📈 Data Analysis and Visualization
The project includes scripts for comprehensive data analysis and visualization. These scripts use libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore the Aquifer Auser dataset.

📊 Predictive Modeling
The project utilizes ARIMA models for time-series forecasting. Auto-ARIMA is used to identify the best parameters for the model.

📜 Example Scripts
Here is an example script for data visualization:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

file = "data/raw/Aquifer_Auser.csv"
total_data = pd.read_csv(file)

# Visualizing data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=total_data, x='Date', y='Depth_to_Groundwater')
plt.show()
