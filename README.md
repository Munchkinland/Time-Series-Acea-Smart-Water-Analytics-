# README for GitHub Repository

This README provides a comprehensive guide for the Time-Series-Acea-Smart-Water-Analytics project. The project is focused on analyzing time-series data related to smart water management, with a specific focus on the Aquifer Auser dataset.

Project Overview
The Time-Series-Acea-Smart-Water-Analytics project aims to analyze and predict water resource behaviors using time-series data. The primary dataset used in this project is Aquifer_Auser.csv, which contains various measurements related to an aquifer in Italy.

Installation
Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these packages using pip:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
Usage
The project structure is as follows:

utils.py: Contains utility functions such as db_connect for database connections.
Data analysis scripts that perform the following tasks:
Data Ingestion
Descriptive Data Analysis
Data Visualization
Data Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Time Series Analysis
Database Connection
To connect to the database, use:


from utils import db_connect
engine = db_connect()

Data Analysis and Visualization
The project includes scripts for comprehensive data analysis and visualization. These scripts use libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore the Aquifer Auser dataset.

Predictive Modeling
The project utilizes ARIMA models for time-series forecasting. Auto-ARIMA is used to identify the best parameters for the model.

Example Scripts
Here is an example script for data visualization:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

file = "data/raw/Aquifer_Auser.csv"
total_data = pd.read_csv(file)

# Visualizing data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=total_data, x='Date', y='Depth_to_Groundwater')
plt.show()
